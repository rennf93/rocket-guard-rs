//! Minimal guarded Rocket application, using the real adapter surface:
//! [`rocket_guard_rs::GuardFairing`] attached once, plus a
//! [`rocket_guard_rs::BlockGuard`] or [`rocket_guard_rs::GuardBody`] argument
//! on every protected route (Rocket's own enforcement mechanism).
//!
//! Routes:
//!
//! | Route | Guard | Behavior |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | `GET /health` | none (excluded) | `200 ok`; scanned by the fairing but never blocked |
//! | `GET /` | `BlockGuard` | `200` greeting |
//! | `GET /search?q=...` | `BlockGuard` | `200 search ok`, or `403` when the query trips the engine |
//! | `POST /echo` | `GuardBody` | echoes the body; `403` for a threat, `413` over the body cap |
//!
//! The `/health` route carries no guard argument, which is the Rocket-shaped
//! excluded path: the fairing still scans it (request fairings see every
//! request), but without a guard argument nothing can refuse the request.
//! That is the same effect the Python distro's excluded-paths configuration
//! has.
