## Project Overview

rocket-guard-rs is the Rocket adapter for the Guard ecosystem. It screens Rocket 0.5 traffic through the [guard-core-rs](https://github.com/rennf93/guard-core-rs) detection engine: [`GuardFairing`](src/fairing.rs) scans path, query, and header views in `on_request` and stashes the verdict in request-local state, and per-route request guards ([`BlockGuard`](src/guards.rs) for bodyless routes, [`GuardBody`](src/guards.rs) for routes with a body) enforce the verdict before a handler runs. It contains no security logic of its own.

- **Repository**: https://github.com/rennf93/rocket-guard-rs
- **Language**: Rust, edition 2024, MSRV 1.92
- **License**: MIT OR Apache-2.0
- **Version**: 0.1.0
- **Status**: implemented and tested. Not published to crates.io: the engine is a local path dependency until it is tagged (see [Engine Dependency](#engine-dependency)).

## Ecosystem Position

```
guard-core (Python)     <- Reference implementation, spec owner (spec 4.0.2)
└── guard-core-rs       <- Rust engine crate: guard-core-engine (detect, preprocessor, semantic, compiler)
    ├── tower-guard-rs  <- Framework-agnostic tower Layer + Service
    ├── axum-guard-rs   <- Sibling adapter (composes tower-guard-rs)
    ├── actix-guard-rs  <- Sibling adapter (Transform + Service)
    └── rocket-guard-rs (this) <- Rocket Fairing + request guards
```

The engine crate stays framework-free (no I/O, no tokio, no framework types). This repository is the opposite side of that boundary: framework glue only. No security logic belongs here; it belongs in guard-core-rs.

## Why the two-piece wiring

Rocket has no middleware chain that can abort a request: `on_request` in a fairing has no outcome return, and a fairing can only peek at the first 512 bytes of a body (`Data::peek` is capped at `PEEK_BYTES`). The adapter therefore splits the work the way Rocket requires:

1. **`GuardFairing`** (`Kind::Ignite | Kind::Request | Kind::Response`): `on_ignite` registers the `403`/`413`/`500` catchers (never over an application-claimed status; Rocket treats same-code catchers at the same base as a fatal collision), `on_request` scans the metadata views and stashes the verdict, `on_response` rewrites a `404` to the guarded `403` when the verdict is a threat (a `404` proves no handler ran, so the rewrite cannot discard work).
2. **Guard arguments on protected routes**: `BlockGuard` for routes without a body, `GuardBody` for routes with one (it buffers up to the cap, scans the body view, and hands the bytes to the handler in one step, because Rocket's `Data` is a one-shot stream).

A route without a guard argument is scanned but never blocked; that is Rocket's own per-route opt-in model. Fail-secure rule: a guard that cannot find a stashed verdict refuses with `500` rather than passing uninspected. The body view is never scanned by the fairing: a truncated scan would be a bypass vector.

## Engine Integration

`guard-core-engine` exposes exactly one detection entry point, which this adapter calls once per request view:

```rust
pub fn detect(content: &str, request_context: &str, config: &DetectConfig) -> DetectVerdict
```

`DetectConfig` has five public fields and **no `Default` impl**; the ecosystem defaults are pinned in `crate::default_config()` (10 000 / 262 144 / true / 0.7 / 1.0), matching the conformance corpus knobs. `DetectVerdict` carries `is_threat`, `threat_score`, `threats`, `original_length`, `processed_length` and **no response shape at all**: the `403`/`413`/`500` translation lives in this adapter (`src/response.rs`) and mirrors the ecosystem's `{"detail":"..."}` JSON error shape.

View mapping (documented in `src/lib.rs` and `src/scan.rs`):

| Request part | Context | Evaluated |
|---|---|---|
| `request.path()` | `url_path` | in the fairing, when not `/` |
| `request.query()` | `query_param` | in the fairing, when non-empty |
| header values | `header` | in the fairing, when the name is not excluded |
| buffered body | `request_body` | in `GuardBody`, when non-empty after lossy UTF-8 decode |

The method is not scanned: `detect` has no method parameter. Non-UTF-8 header values are skipped (they cannot be represented as `&str`).

## Engine Dependency

- `Cargo.toml` declares `guard-core-engine = { path = "../guard-core-rs/crates/guard-core-engine", version = "0.0.1" }`.
- **TODO(engine):** switch to the versioned crates.io dependency once `guard-core-rs` is tagged and published.
- The engine crate is used directly, not the `guard-core-rs` facade crate, because the facade re-exports only `compiler`, `preprocessor`, and `semantic`. If the facade later re-exports `detect`, switching is a one-line change.
- CI checks out `rennf93/guard-core-rs` (branch `master`, moving branch by design, documented in `.github/workflows/ci.yml`) into `../guard-core-rs` before building, mirroring `tower-guard-rs`. Do not replace that with a git dependency without updating the CI comment and this file.

## Development Commands

CI is the source of truth (`.github/workflows/*.yml`); there is no Makefile.

```bash
cargo check --all-targets                              # type check
cargo fmt --all -- --check                             # format gate
cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings              # lint gate (pedantic is warn, so -D warnings enforces it)
cargo test                                             # unit + integration + doctests (workspace: adapter + examples)
RUSTDOCFLAGS="-D warnings" cargo doc --no-deps         # rustdoc gate
cargo deny check                                       # advisories, licenses, bans, sources (deny.toml)
```

A sibling `guard-core-rs` checkout at `../guard-core-rs` is required for every command.

The example apps under `examples/` build and run like any workspace member:

```bash
docker compose -f examples/simple_app/docker-compose.yml up --build -d --wait    # live smoke stack
SMOKE_PORT=8091 docker compose -f examples/simple_app/docker-compose.yml up ...   # remapped host port
```

The compose stacks also need the sibling `../guard-core-rs` checkout: the
Dockerfile receives the engine source through a compose
`additional_contexts` entry named `engine` pointing at `../../../guard-core-rs`
(relative to the compose file). The `live-smoke` workflow runs the simple_app
stack and the full curl assertion matrix on every push/PR; `upstream-drift`
runs the suite daily against a fresh `guard-core-rs@master` checkout placed at
the path dependency location. `security.yml` runs `cargo deny check` on
push/PR and weekly. `release.yml` gates `v*` tag pushes with the full suite
plus a tag/version consistency check; crates.io publishing is manual and
owner-gated.

## Testing

- `cargo test` runs the unit tests (`src/`), the integration tests (`tests/integration.rs`, Rocket local client), and the doctests. All must pass.
- Coverage must include: benign passthrough, threats blocked via `BlockGuard` and via `GuardBody`, engine panic to `500` (the `#[cfg(test)]` detector seam), the 404-to-403 rewrite, catcher non-collision, body cap `413`, and per-route opt-in (a route without a guard argument is not blocked).
- Payloads must come from the spec 4.0.2 conformance corpus (`guard-core-rs/conformance/guard-core-spec-4.0.2/cases/`) so they are guaranteed threats, not guesses.

## Code Quality Standards

- `[lints]` in `Cargo.toml`: `unsafe_code = "forbid"`, `clippy::all = "deny"`, `clippy::pedantic = "warn"` (enforced as errors by CI's `-D warnings`). `clippy::nursery` is deliberately not enabled: its lints drift between clippy versions.
- No `#[allow(...)]` in `src/`.
- rustdoc warnings are errors in CI.

## Best Practices

1. **Keep the engine call surface unchanged.** Every request goes through the fairing scan and, for bodies, through `GuardBody`; both recover engine panics into `500`. Do not bypass the recovery.
2. **Do not weaken fail-secure.** Any new failure path must map to `500` or a documented rejection, never to an uninspected passthrough.
3. **Run the full local gate before committing**: fmt, clippy, test, doc, cargo deny. CI runs all five.
4. **Example apps are part of the workspace.** `examples/simple_app` and `examples/advanced_app` build with a plain `cargo build` from the repo root; when you change the adapter's public API or response shapes, update the examples and their READMEs (and re-run the live smoke assertions) in the same change.
5. **Conventional commits** (`feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, `ci:`), matching history. No AI attribution in commit messages.
6. **Document status honestly.** Nothing here is published; say so in the README and crate docs rather than implying a crates.io release. crates.io publishing is manual and owner-gated; the release workflow only gates the tag.
7. **Keep the engine surface claims honest.** guard-core-rs currently ships the CPU-bound detection pipeline only: no Redis, rate limiter, or ban manager. Do not document capabilities the engine does not expose.
